Things to do:

Implement orbital class that calculates the correct wave function for a given set of quantum numbers.
Implement the slater determinant class so that it can be used in a wave function class, which again calls the orbital class for data.
Implement a new wave function class that uses the slater determinant.
Make the slater class smarter so that it can calculate ratios by only moving one particle at the time.
