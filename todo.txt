Things to do:

Implement the evolutional algorithm
Test the evolutional algorithm on minimization problems
Look for DMC-like methods that utilize evolution

Set up a scripting system that takes care of running different configurations at the same time. It should have the followin features:
- read a folder of config files, where each config file has a distinctive name which will be used on subsequent data files and such
- contain a list of available machines to run on
- check whether the data for the given run already exists - if it does, the data should not be recreated
- SSH into each machine and execute the program with the number of available processors or 1 if specified in the config file
- add lock mechanism so that the same run is not being performed by two processors at the same time

Evolutionary algorithm:
Create a walker that is based on brute force monte carlo
Use this walker instead of MonteCarloStandard
(Make MonteCarloStandard use this walker)
Give an walker to each individual
Let each individual reuse its walker's positions
Let the other coefficients/genes determine the new walker's initial positions?


Could be done, but not to do:
- Update only parts of gradient affected by moved particle
